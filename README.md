This is a R project for creating demo EPIDEMIA forecasting reports using the epidemiar package.

Demo is based off a real implementation for forecastng malaria in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, however surveillance data in this demo have been simulated.

The main script to open and run is `run_epidemiar_demo.R`.

Many of the customized scripts are based around issues in the real situation which do not exist in the simulated data, but are retained in the code here for demonstration on how it could work (e.g. data cleaning functions inside data corral functions for collating surveillance data). 

See walkthrough and other documentation in this project under the `documentation` folder, specifically `walkthrough.pdf`.
